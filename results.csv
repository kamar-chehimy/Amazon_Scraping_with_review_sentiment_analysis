While I'll admit that sour cream does not make a good substitute for egg-protein shampoo---even if it is HILARIOUS---I think this is all a means of her keeping me down/causing me to spend countless panicked hours standing in front of displays weeping and trying to figure out what to do to avoid ridicule.,When my wife asked me to pick up a hair dryer, I remember feeling a moment of terror followed by a moment of confusion when I woke up from the shopping-induced blackout 3 days later in a place filled exclusively with other people who have clearly lost their mind: A Taylor Swift concert.  After taking several ""selfies"" and spending the next several hours vomiting, I found myself alone on the field after the concert.  As I sat helplessly trying to figure out how I could ever get through this purchase, a figure approached me through the shadows.  She moved with the effortless grace of a talentless moron who somehow struck a nerve amongst an entire generation of ignorant morons, bringing her unimaginable wealth and really stupid shades of lipstick.  She sat down next to me silently and pulled out the special iPhone ""iAwful"" model which is made of poached ivory, baby seal eyes, and hair stolen from dead peasant farmers.  She only said one thing as she tapped on the seal-eye-screen: ""hairdryer.""  In that moment while she whispered, I was almost able to forget how awful her entire catalogue of music is, but then I remembered the one about ""never ever ever ever getting a decent songwriter"" or whatever and pretty much immediately wished she'd go away.,As I was trying to figure the fastest way to run, she showed me what she was looking at.  A hairdryer.  A hairdryer quite unlike anything I had ever seen before.  It was as if someone had woven together the spirits of the ridiculously awful Goop brand with the corpse of Jimmy Hoffa---it was both revolting and captivating at the same time.  The handles were made of some chic looking garbage that is probably the highly toxic after-product of some illegal Chinese industrial process, disguised by some flowery name that's supposed to make you forget that Gwyneth Paltrow has no soul.  The motor claimed a rating of 1.21 Gigawatts, and included a suspicious ""pull in case of fire"" emergency handle.  While I'd like to go into more detail about this super luxe product, I can't because I was temporarily stricken with hysterical blindness when I saw the price tag of $10,000, or as Taylor called it ""one-ooooooooooooooh"" because celebrities don't understand money or know how to read, write, or speak.,As my eyesight slowly returned, I found myself alone again on that field.  For a moment I pondered how peaceful it looked, despite the fact that a truly awful gathering of people had stood here mere hours before.  I pulled out my phone, opened the Amazon app, screamed at Alexa to show me hairdryers and please stop spying on me while I poop.  I closed my eyes and chose blindly.,When the package arrived two days later, I had already assumed the fetal position to prepare for belittlement.  But something happened.  I heard the hairdryer turn on and also took note of the distinct absence of the sound of it being throw against the wall.  A few minutes later, my wife emerged holding the hairdryer and said ""This works really well.  The little doohickey things really sped up the drying process.  Nice purchase honey.""  While it was hard to formulate words due to the amount of drool on my face at that time, I believe I managed to spit out the phrase ""welcome to paradise"" before fainting from surprise.  I did something right. How could this have happened?,As I reflect on this I realize that I have to thank Taylor Swift more than anyone else.  Not only did she make me realize that I hate toxic haircare tools, but she also helped me to realize that listening to her sing and having to interact with her afterwards was actually the worst thing I could have possibly imagined this side of a Kardashian family reunion.  The realization that no matter what I chose or how much berating resulted from it or how many soiled pairs of underwear I had to hide afterwards, there was nowhere to go but up at this very moment.  I let go and chose blindly.  And I chose right.  I chose right.,I bought one of these 15 years ago, and it only just stopped working. I was happy to see that I could still buy the same model. I love that it has low and high fan as well as low and high heat options. My local stores do not sell these models, so this is the only place to buy it.,I had the exact same hair dryer for a few years and noticed the power had started to get degraded and got the exact sane one again because I love having both a Turbo and a Cold shot in addition to the other features.  I had looked at alot of hair dryers and some were quite expensive but they didn't offer all the features I was looking for so I came back to this one and glad I did.,If you want to spend $100.00 + for a hairdryer, this ain't for you. Just works and it's light. Always had good luck with these and for under 20 bucks, you jus cant go wrong. It's cheap because of ultimate power but it's built nice and my wife, who has long hair, loves it!,First one lasted forever....Easy to hold and use....Highly recommended....",,

I spent over $150 on a very reputable brand which claimed to be lightweight, even had that word in the title. I could barely lift it up much less hold it up for any sustainable amount of time. When I used this dryer, which cost me maybe $12 (perhaps there was a sale because it’s now more expensive), it was wonderful. Still hurts a wee bit, but remarkably better than anything else I’d tried. I love this dryer!,Really like this. Was using Babybliss and I think it was frying my hair. I need a lightweight dryer as I have arthritic hands. The controls work great. It is very gentle on hair, I am not getting as much frizz and flyaway. My only issue is with the cord length- very short, sometimes I end up pulling it out of the socket. Problem solved with extension cord.,So light weight . Power is good but not overpowering and makes my hair looks great . I only dry my hair right before I go out but I let it air dry as much as I can before I leave .,It’s very light weight and has good heating power. Smooths my hair fast.,This Revlon hairdryer replaces one I had for over 15 years!  It is the best as far as I am concerned.  Easy to use and fairly lightweight.  I cannot complain about how long the old one lasted. In fact, I may have had that hair dryer for longer than 15 years since I forgot now how long I had it really.  Never problem with it either.,One thing that's missing from new model.  I used to be able to take off the back part of the blower above the handle the clean the lint and dust accumulation that tends to accumulate over time.  That probably kept it running longer as a clogged blower will definitely make the electric motor run hotter and wear it out sooner.,I like the price VS quality of Revlon hair dryers. I wish I had spent the money to buy the model with the retractable cord.  The retractable cord is much easier to store. My retractable cord dryer bit the dust after 6 years but the cord still retracted!,The only suggestion I would make for this product would be to make the cord at least 6 inches longer. I would recommend this product.,Light weight,  quiet, so far,  so good.,Potencia suficiente, la estrella faltante es porque falta opción para solo soplar aire sin calentar.

I purchased this based on reviews from other curly haired reviewers. I have very think, courses, loose curly hair. After recently going back to wearing my hair curly I was struggling with the amount of time it took to dry my hair. My Deva dryer took over 45 minutes to get my hair about 75 % dry. With the shark dryer my hair is 90% dry is just over 15 minutes. As an added bonus my loose curls form in coils which has never happened before. The diffuser and dryer have been a life changer for me!!!!,My jaw is on the ground after 1st use. My hair is shoulder length, very wavy, and color treated auburn (was platinum for 6 years and extremely damaged). I used with no attachment to get to about 80% dry, then used brush attachment. Was able to dry straight in less than 5 minutes with no need for flat iron!!! *I also use Oribe Gold Lust line to repair and protect. Looking forward to having long, healthy hair again :),This dryer’s drying power is great save half of your time for a complete dry,  weight is a bit on the heavy side, handle comfort is average, I really like how the filter is design easy to clean with just a couple of Q-tips, and last the cold shot button is convenient.  I’ll give this an 8.8/10.  I would give it another .5 point if this have an heat/Fan automatic function.,Have been using this hair dryer for about a month now. Works great, heats up quickly, very comfortable to hold and lightweight.,I wish attachments had markings on side for alignment purposes, because there were many times attachment would fall off and then you realize it wasn’t seated properly. Or if it had a locking mechanism it would work better.,Otherwise pretty good hair dryer so far, no issues. Hopefully it lasts a long time.,You mean to tell me that all these years I’ve been spending up to 60 bucks for a blow out when I could’ve done it myself?! Also the diffuser is great for curly girls. A good investment. I have lots of hair and after about 45 min I’m done and have sleek hair. Only issue is it’s a bit heavy, but not a deal breaker,This dryer is fantastic! I only have to dry my hair for 20 mins and not an hour! 30 mins if I do a deep conditioning treatment! That would take me well over an hour! It's a bit loud but I just put a small cotton in each ear. No biggie as hair dryers are loud in general. My curly hair is bouncy and shiny. I treat this dryer like gold! Thanks to Amazon day, I was able to afford this and I'm so happy I did! Worth every penny.,When you turn it on and off it makes a weird sound. The only way I can describe it is the tools at the dentist. Like a sucking whining sound. It’s only when you turn it on and off though so if you can grit your teeth and deal with it it’s not too bad.,Otherwise it’s a great dryer. I use it with the diffuser for my curly hair and it takes about 30 minutes to dry all over.",,

This hair dryer is perfect for ""Black hair"".  Easy to handle.  What made the purchase fantastic were all the accessories it came with. What I particularly found problematic is that the handle should be much longer.  I found myself pressing the buttons on the handle while blow drying my hair.  I've never had this issue with any other products of this type.,I wont say it's bad since compare to others this still has good attributes however when holding it it can be hard for me to keep it at a certain level it has 2 buttons on the handle and when putting pressure it can change the temp of the dryer or the speed it also comes with extras and those are a 10/10 the clips and the other drying methods can help if used in another dryer i believe however don't expect much guys-:)✌️🤴-luv 😘💋,Gets hot, but don’t use an extension cord…..it will melt…..that hot.  Holding….good for the most part, until your arm gets tired.  It is lightweight.  This dryer leaves my hair soft and laying down.  I have real thick hair, so that’s an A+ in my book.,My absolute favorite hair dryer. It is my second time purchasing the hair dryer. But I do have to say my first lasted longer than I expected. I’ve had it for a good three years maybe four and I just now had to replace it. Silky straight with amazing tools that come with it. Perfection,Sooo my old hair drier broke in the middle of me doing my hair.. which was a huge inconvenience! I ordered this one in replacement of my old one and it came the following day. I can say it works the same as my old one, if not better.,This is the best blow dryer I’ve every had no lie, it dries my hair so quickly and efficiently. It is easy to hold and I love the fact that it has multiple setting because my last blow dryer only had an on and off switch. Very light weight & strong. I also love the fact that it comes with multiple drying heads, whether I want to wear my natural hair or if I want to dry a wig. I love it! Never going back to my old blow dryer.,I needed a new blow dryer and didn’t want to do the old school comb attachment. So I picked this one up and it’s pretty powerful. You have to hold it from the top( gripping the comb attachment and the shaft of the blow dryer) and not by the handle for thick hair.  I use it mostly on a  4B/4C hair and I don’t want the attachment to fly off so I have to hold it differently. I like how the buttons are easy to reach. I broke one of the teeth but it still works really well. I haven’t used any of the other attachments yet. Cool air is not super cold. Hot gets super hot though.No problems yet.,Lots of extra tools with this hair dryer,I love my new Kiss blow-dryer. It is easy to use and dries my hair well. I especially love the comb attachment. What a wonderful change. My old blow-dryer didn't have a comb attachment and I tried using a universal brand but it kept falling off. This one is so good. The comb attachment fits very well and is easy to put on and off. This is good value for the money.,'Straight out of the Amazon BAG (the thin blowdryer box was only in an envelope) I tried the dryer - Nothing! Just Dead. Of course I tried it in several plugs, pressed all the buttons no air, no heat, no cold shot, surprisingly when I tried the test/reset button on the plug - on test nothing happened but when I pressed reset I got a blast of air. I'm fairly sure the test / reset button is supposed to work the other way. Either way I have a defective / dead blowdryer and have to go through the trouble of going to buy a box and going to Purolator to return this piece of junk. The Amazon Customer Service Rep was very nice, she promptly sent out another at no cost pending receipt of the other. I should receive it in 2 days. :)",,

Having had relaxed hair since I was 12, it’s taken a while to get used to this new texture. And I generally wear my hair in French braids. But I really hate the fact that it takes me two hours to do my hair. So much so that I’ve contemplated getting a texturizer or even going back to relaxing just to make the process quicker. But I thought I would give this dryer a try and it absolutely does what it says. You do have to be careful because the paddle part gets extremely hot and I did burn my finger when I wasn’t paying attention. And obviously it doesn’t give you the same results as a silk press, flat iron, or hot comb. It’s more like a good blow out. Which is all I was looking for to be able to braid my hair quicker. I still put heat protectant on it and leave in conditioner and it works well for me.,I love this hair dryer because I have thin, straight hair and it keeps my cuticle flat while drying. A regular dryer blows all over the place and requires two hands...one for the brush, and one for the dryer. This little guy makes things a lot easier. The cord is very short which is okay because of my bathroom set up but I can see where this would be annoying for some. I have a lot less fly away hairs due to being able to control my hair while drying. I'm not sure that this dryer would  work well for someone with curly, super textured hair or extremely thick hair because the blowing power is not super powerful.,I love how handy this dryer is with the brush & dryer as one unit. It can dry your hair with heat or cold air. Gets its blown out well for curly, textured hair but does not get it as straight as I had hoped. I’ve tried it on both my daughter and myself with similar results. It’s a little big for travel in a carry on and somewhat heavy/wide to hold completely without discomfort. But I’m grateful to not have to worry about my comb attachments falling off my dryer anymore. Still one of the best products for the price.,I typically air dry my hair, however I have found the need to acquire a blow-dryer.,The blow-dryer was light weight, much to my surprise. Which is very convenient because if you have long type 4 hair, you don't want to have something heavy in your hand for long periods of time.,I haven't given much thought to travelling with the blow-dryer but it is light enough to slip into a travel bag although I would worry about bending or breaking the brush brittles attached.,I have thick, long type 4 hair and used it to dry my hair after washing.  I used it on the cool and low heat settings and my hair was dried well and stretched without feeling crispy.,The only ""issue"" is the dial to change the blow-dryer settings was not like the others where I could easily adjust with one hand.  But a small price to pay considering what a great job it did.,Recently just used it on the first go it exceeded my expectations. I love this hair dryer. I finished my whole head in nearly less than an hour. I have thick curly hair and it stretched my curls right on out. I did stretch my hair after my wash day so it could dry a bit though. Definitely will continue to use this hair dryer once a month. Please make sure to keep it clean for longevity of use.,There's so much to be said!",,

The texture and  the shine of my hair the thickness it’s been amazing since I switched it to this dryer.,I really can’t explain why there’s such a difference in my hair since I started using this. I have very fine hair, not super thin but I wouldn’t say thick either. I have been telling my family to get one.,I really like this hair dryer. I had bought one at Marshalls a year or so ago and it finally gave out. I liked it so much that I went on Amazon to buy the same one. It's a different color, but works just as good as the old one. You won't be disappointed. It's great for the house, kinda big to travel with though.,Was replacing with same product but found out cord is only 6 feet not 10 feet. Unable to use because cord is too short. They need to put in product description. I had looked but there was no description and I had assumed it was like my previous model.,It’s lightweight and pretty quiet for a hair dryer… but really powerful!  My hair dries fast but it doesn’t damage my hair - it’s truly great!,The last one I had of this brand I bought in 2010 so it’s 12 years old. It still works but it was getting noisy and I think it’s in on its way out.,The older was was more heavy and loud but it dried my hair fast and left my hair smooth.,I have the same results with this one - but it’s a much more light and quiet dryer.  I couldn’t be happier.,Highly recommend",overstockdrugstore,overstockdrugstore

The buttons are in a weird spot BUT, it dries my hair super fast and it leaves it very soft and silky,Strong, smooth,Good quality.  Not the lightest,If you have long thick hair this is the one!  Drying time is half the time!  Pricey yes but WELL WORTH IT!,My hair stylist has this so I bought one for myself.  It has a nice 3 speed for power and heat and other than being slightly heavier than I would like, I love it.,I tried 3 different hairdryers, T3 curio, ghd helios, and the yellow one which I forgot the name of (which was not hot enough to smooth out curls/frizz).  T3 curio was not hot enough, but was very lightweight, and did not dry fast enough as well.  GHD Helios is heavier (the only downside), but really smoothed out my curly hair very quickly.  Definitely hot enough and still protects the hair because of the way it is made.  It's the most amount of money I have spent before, but it is certainly worth having smooth hair without spending a lot of time.,Buenísimo blower seca muy bien y rápido lo único que deben mejorar son los botones de prender y apagar están muy cerca del botón de frío. Pero no deja de ser buen blower,I was a little hesitant at first with buying the GHD Helios at first. But, after lots of research.. I decided to just do it & try it out.,It really is the best blowdryer I have had. Drying time was just as described and reviewed. Super fast! Temperature didn’t fluctuate, weight is super light, the button functionality is great! Didn’t have to use my GHD gold flat iron much after... only for small area touch ups due to having naturally wavy hair.  I was very worried about getting the white & rose gold with concern of it getting dirty... but, it doesn’t. It’s absolutely stunning! Definitely recommend. Very happy I decided to try out & look forward to my morning routines even more.,Any men out there in the doghouse, this is the gift that will get you out.

I read any and all reviews from users who had locs to get info on how it worked for them. And most of the reviews said it took a long time to dry, but that it worked. Well, now I can confirm!,I have locs that are about 3ft long, and one of my main concerns when washing my hair is whether they'll dry all the way through and how long it will take. So I'll report on that for anyone else who may have the same questions.,1) First I made sure to remove as much moisture from my hair (after washing and before twisting it) as possible, so that it wouldn't get messy in the bonnet. I did have to get strategic on how I loaded my locs up into the bonnet once I was done twisting them though. I dried them in sections. I dried my scalp first, then put the rest of my locs in the bonnet to dry the middle sections and the ends. Then about every 30 minutes until fully dry, I would part my hair at different places to allow a different section of my hair to receive the maximum air flow and dry.,2) It generally takes about 3-4 hours to dry my hair all the way through in a shop, and guess what? It took about 4 hours to dry my hair under this bonnet on Medium. And all of the things I did in the first section are all of the things I have to do when I'm under the shop dryer too. I mean, don't get me wrong, 4 hours is a long time, but I put on two movies and by the time I finished the second movie, my hair was done. I was terrified that I'd be under there for 6+, so for me, this was a nice surprise.,3) The dryer is loud. Maybe it's because I read previous reviews that I wasn't annoyed by how loud it was, but it was loud. I sometimes put the captions on on my TV, but I HAD to put the captions on if I wanted to know what they were saying in the movies. My dog didn't care much for the noise either. But by the 2nd hour she got used to it to the point that she even fell asleep to the nice loud hum of the dryer. lol,I didn't take any pictures at the time, but I was surprised by how well my hair turned out. I think I was so tired by the time my hair was dry the I was just ready to go to bed (I washed my hair at night.. I won't do that again). My old hair shop is now charging nearly $250 for wash and loc maintenance, which is just ridiculous. I know that I'm paying for the service of having someone else care for my hair and massage my scalp and all that, but the longest part of the whole service is mostly me sitting underneath the dryer. I spend about 1 hour at the wash bowl and in the service chair. The rest of that time is me sitting under the dryer for 3 hours. So, yes, I think this is ridiculous. Until I find another shop, I'll have to find another way to treat myself to something nice and save myself $250. Or maybe I'll just keep doing my own hair and find other ways to spend (save) that money. If I have any complaints at all, they don't have anything to do with the actual dryer. The dryer cord is about 2 ft long. It would be nice if it was longer, but it's doable. And besides being loud, my parted off locs weren't as clean as when my hairdresser does it, but it wasn't that far off though, and I'm hoping that I'll get better at it the more reps I have at it.,I'll upload pictures next time I do my hair. I'm about 2 weeks out, so I'll wait and take fresh pics next time.,In response to all of the reviewers who stated that their hose will not stay attached, the trick is to twist the hose into the cap until you hear it ""click"" into place.  No more hose disconnects after that, and I used it for about 2-hours worth of drying time.  I removed the cap and put it back on at least twice during that time and the hose stayed attached.,The ONLY reason that I am taking away 1 star is because the cap is NOT as big as the description implies.  I have a LOT of hair and the band around the cap squeezed my head uncomfortably until I took the cap off and removed some of my hair clips to reduce the bulk.,Other than that, this product did exactly what it said it would do, and I'm happy with my purchase.",,

The problem with this pink one is that the pink coating started to peel and flake off in less than one month of use.  It wouldn't be a big deal except that pieces of the pink paint were falling into my hair while I was blow drying and I spent more time picking out the flakes than actually trying to dry my hair.  I had to throw it in the trash.  The white version does not have this issue.,I have type 3A/B curly hair and recently moved from California to Alaska. I’ve always been an air dry gal but that won’t work anymore once Alaska’s winter rolls around. I got this dryer thinking I’ll upgrade later, but tbh I think I’ll stick with this one.,I diffuse my hair and it’s 80% dry within 15 min of LOW heat. I was so impressed! The dryer is fairly lightweight. I have bad wrists from years of typing and I don’t feel bothered holding the dryer for a while.,It also has a built in loop to hang it from which I love. Storing blow dryers is a bit of a pain and this helped me out.,I never have smelled that “hair burning” smell, y’all know the one. Which is comforting since it means the heat damage will be extremely minimal (if any!).,this dryer is definitely worth trying instead of spending hundreds on some of the big name blow dryers out there right now.,This hairdryer dries substantially faster than other generic/cheap ones I have so I am left to conclude that the IR lights do work.,Also I use the attachments constantly and have no issues with them even after hundreds of uses and swaps.,I ordered mine 1 year and 2 days ago and it’s still going flawlessly, which to me makes this an unbeatable value. Definitely recommend,And my old one died and I had to get a new one I saw all these reviews and I thought I'd try it out. All previous reviews were spot on! This hair dryer dries my hair so fast it and it lights up which is not a selling Factor but I thought it was cool.

I was expecting those to be amazing and blow this one out of the water. No. They were ok, not even great. I came home to my reasonably priced version here and it's everything I want it to be. Lots of power, quick drying, I do blowouts on myself way more than I ever have with other dryers because it's so easy.,This dryer is very well made and feels like a sturdy, high-quality product.  It's a bit heavier than my last dryer, but not heavy enough to be any problem. It is also makes a little more noise than I'm used to, but that's also not a problem for me. It dries exceptionally well, much quicker than my old dryer did. The attachments fit easily and stay put while using the dryer. All in all, this is a great product and I'm very happy with it.,The hair dryer has two speeds--high and low--and those regulate the temperature as well. It has a nice ""cool-down"" button. The color is really pretty, and the hair dryer is pretty compact--although a little too big to take for travel in my mind, even with the handle folded in.,I was hoping this dryer would diminish the frizzies from my hair, but it doesn't seem to.,But it does dry my hair really fast, and I like the large attachment that distributes the air in a large area of my head in one pass.,I blow dry my hair everyday. I had the expensive ones and I thought of giving this one a try. Never going back. It does everything g it says. Hair dries fast and beautiful, and it is not heavy. Would repurchase many times. and I am giving it as a present to friends.,I got this for my wife over a year ago and it is working like the day we received it.,Good purchase for the price.,I originally bought this hairdryer to keep at my son's house when I visit. I have 2 other (less powerful) hairdryers at home. None of them has the blowing power of the Infiniti Pro (Conair). So, I bought another one to keep at home. The 2 inferior hairdryers go in the guest bathroom.,Okay so I just bought and used this hair dryer and I'm so happy with it!

I also looked for a brand I recognized and found this one which fit all my needs. The temps are spot on and the diffuser works great. I bought it only a few months ago but it has so far held up well. I think this brand continues to be a popular brand because of the quality of their products and prices.  The handle doesn’t fold in to make it more compact for storage and I haven’t travelled with it yet but I don’t see why it wouldn’t travel well or for it to fit easily in a bag or suitcase. If you’re looking for a diffuser attachment, great quality, multiple heat and fan speed options and a reasonable price then this product sells itself.,I got this hair dryer about a week ago because my old one finally bit the dust. I didn’t realize how much damage the old one did to my hair until I used this one! Previously I had to use my straightening iron on my hair to tame the frizz. This hair dryer rocks!! I basically retired my straightening iron because this hair dryer leaves my hair so soft and smooth! I was blown away by the smoothness of my hair after using this hair dryer. I also love how quiet this hair dryer is and it’s pretty lightweight too which is a plus. If I had to come up with cons I’d say the hot setting isn’t very hot and the wind power on the low setting feels like a high setting on other hair dryers.,Bought to use with black orchid diffuser. Diffuser falls off if I don’t push hard enough but not a big deal. My hair doesn’t get sucked in the back as some comment on and there’s a plastic cover over the back which seems to help prevent that. Dries my hair very quickly. It is pretty mound but hasn’t woke. Up my baby who sleeps across the hall albeit with a loud sound machine. I haven’t tried it without the diffuser and I haven’t tried it with the included attachments.,I bought this for my curly hair because it had a diffuser, a low heat option, and a true cold shot. I have not been disappointed. It's light weight and pretty quiet for a dryer. I love the low heat setting and it dries my thick wavy curly hair in about 20 minutes with no heat. The diffuser is perfect. It's not cumbersome to travel with and I have had no issues with it!,I needed a new travel dryer for our 5th wheel. I require a warm setting. I have very long medium thick hair that is graying (silver ladies, you need to turn the heat down on your hair tools!). After reading the reviews I had concerns that the warm setting wouldn’t be warm enough. On first use I thought “oh no, this isn’t going to work!”  Then I pointed it directly at my scalp and realized it was much warmer than I thought!  This amazing little (it is so compact!!) dryer does an excellent job on my hair. It is fast, easy to use, the concentrator nozzle  stays on, it’s light and fits in a small space for travel. I am very happy.,I'm a male and have been using this for a few months now. It's very powerful - like a mini wind tunnel - which allows it to dry very quickly. It also adjusts very quickly to changing the heat settings.,I have short hair with an inconsistent growth pattern (the nap grows in slightly different directions). This powerful, quick-drying performance enables me to quickly ""sculpt"" my style when I step out of the shower. I hope they continue making this model for many years to come.,This dryer has some strong power but even a little too strong for my curly hair. On low speed it blew it around, even with a diffuser, making frizz. I need something a bit gentler. But it is very lightweight and would be great for travel. Though if you have long hair beware of the vent - my hair got sucked in it a couple times, as well as anything i got too close to.,Great value for this hairdryer. The quality is great. It has a lot of power, while also not being too loud. I was impressed and so glad I got it to upgrade from my old one. In comparison, my old hairdryer was a lot less powerful and a lot louder, so this was a great purchase to replace that. It looks nice too, with the rose gold accents on the black looking very classy. My only complaint is that's it's kind of heavy for me, and my arms are tired after I've been using it for a bit. But maybe I just need to put on some muscle lol.,One of the best hair dryers I’ve ever had, feels very sturdy, compact and sleek, yet the power is no less than those professional salon models. It’s not super light weight and it doesn’t have dual voltage, so it’s not convenient for travelling but I only use it at home anyway. Great product for the price.",,

I was pleasantly surprised. I did hair for 16 years, and it took a beating my my wrists, hands, and shoulders. As I get older it's harder for me to work a round brush through my hair efficiently and hold my tools above my head as easily. This thing gets HOT, so be careful. I am glad to report it easily glides through  my shoulder length hair (even with a lot of product) and dries my hair in half the time as my blow dryer did. You are basically zapping two birds with one stone here, you get the benefit of the oval brush shape (round brushing) and it also dries your hair super fast. For the price, I'm more than happy and I highly recommend. Another perk, the controls are at the bottom of the tool, not the neck, so I can hold it and work it through my hair without accidentally turning it off or messing with the heat setting. Love it, do get yourself one!,I really wanted this thing to work, but had to return it. I have shorter hair and always have trouble getting fullness at the crown so I bought this since it has a smaller diameter brush than my Revlon One step 2.0.,The only con (because it really is a nice tool) for me:,The brush did not grab my hair at all…it just slid through so it completely defeats my goal.,Pros:,It does heat up fast,the brush is detachable for cleaning,the handle is easy to hold.,Possibly better for longer hair that will more easily wrap around the brush.,I’ve been using a Revlon One Step for years.  After having 3 and wrecking the brushes I decided to try the Hot Tools version.  I like that I can purchase replacement brush heads.  When I saw the smaller round brush I had to give it a try.  After drying with the large brush head, I used the small round head to curl my longish hair.  It looked beautiful and shiny and the curls last! So much easier than a curling iron! Love it!",Ellevate U,Ellevate U

My only complaint so far is that is it is extremely loud. But I just put my earbuds in and listened to some music to help drown out how noisy it was.,This replaces a 30 year old dryer.  The temperature and speed settings are good. The body is made of a hard plastic which in the first few uses didn't get too warm. If this lasts for 30 years, it will be more than worth the $.,Bought hood dry finally use it. The head do not adjust well. Heat okay doesn't gett real hot like beauty shop. But will get the job done,Tip for those having trouble getting the lower part of their hair dry (for longer hair): Drape a bath-sized, dry towel over the top of the hood to hold in the heat more (Try clipping the towel together in one or two places also with hair claw clips). This will get heat to more of your hair so the bottom portion dries. From what I can tell, this does not block the air flow, because the air is pulled in at the base of the unit. This was a trick that my hair salon recommended.,I agree with other reviewers that it is annoying that the heat openings are only in the upper portion of the inside, and not all the way down the sides (see my photo). Also, the air does blow more strongly out of the bigger holes toward the back of my head. I did have to turn my head some when drying so it would dry evenly. The towel trick helps fix these problems some. I researched a lot online, but I was not able to find a collapsible/portable dryer that had even heat openings over the entire hood.,Adjusting the height: Additional section expands from the base of the unit (it's collapsed into the base when not expanded). Once you've set up the unit with the hood open, push down on the base with one hand (to keep the unit from tipping), put your other hand on the neck of the dryer and pull up hard. See my photos of the dryer set up at the lower height, versus the close-up photo with the section expanded.,Set-up: I put the dryer on my kitchen table, and then turned a kitchen chair around so the back is against the table. This also put the chair back against the dryer and helped stabilize the dryer. Otherwise, the dryer seemed a little likely to tip. I'm 5'4"" and with the dryer sitting on the kitchen table, I didn't need to expand the height of the dryer.,Drying time: I have shoulder length, very thick and curly hair. I style my hair very wet with product (but down, no rollers), and I was able to get it partially dry in about a half hour using the low heat setting. I recommend staying on low heat because medium got too hot for me, but I do like having the different heat settings to try.,Overall, I like being able to sit and read while having my hair dried, just like at a salon. I don't think it is much faster than using a hand dryer with a diffuser attachment, but now my arm is not sore from holding up the dryer for a half hour+, and I have time to read.,Being able to return...If you are unsure if the dryer will work for you, make sure to buy from a seller that says ""shipped by Amazon"". I chose to pay around $8 more for one shipped by Amazon, but this one offered free returns. I think other sellers that ship directly don't allow free returns. I like the dryer enough that I will probably keep it now, but I'm still happy I could try it out with the return option.",WeSSENTIALS,WeSSENTIALS

It's no quieter than my old one.  The cord is about half the length of my last hair dryer. I have an old house and the outlets in the bathroom are few and far between so the short cord is inconvenient.,I mean it dries hair eventually, but it’s loud and a little heavy and the cord is not long enough. Not the dryer for long hair.,So I absolutely love this dryer! It does what it's supposed to. I use it on a nearly daily basis and my hair always comes out very smooth. Literally the only down side to this dryer is the cord and plug. The cord is extremely short and the plug always falls out of my outlet no matter which one I use (probably because the cord is so short). I'm only 5'3 and the cord is about 4' I think but I have to use an extension cord to be able to use this without any cord/plug issues. For me this is fine and the reason for 4 stars because I can deal with the extension cord and had a spare one to use. If my hair didn't come out as smooth as it does then I probably wouldn't use it. I bought this to replace my old CHI blow dryer that I was gifted nearly 6 years ago that was starting to lose life. I can honestly say I have not noticed a difference in my drying experience since switching to this one (other than the cord) because this is a really great hair dryer.,Lightweight…not much room for thumb between switch & body of dryer but otherwise great!,I waited a while to review this. I so wanted a copy of my old model and it just was not to be had. This is perfect. I like the addition of the diffusier attachment. It is very easy to attach and also remove.but does not fall off when using it. I have naturally wavy hair , it really unlocks the curls and gives a nice bounce to my hair for a nautural look. I have small hands and do not find it cumbersome or too heavy. It is easy to one handed change the heat to cool. Definately user friendly,Bought this one to replace a previous model we've been using for nearly 18 years. Love the lightness, the ease of use and that it dries quickly without leaving hair crispy - an issue I've had for years because my hair holds water far longer than it should. It no longer takes 45 minutes to damp dry my hair and I'm ticked pink.,Highly recommend!,Superrrrrrr,La secadora es buena es ligera no es muy ruidosa es practica para agarrarse no es muy voluminosa seca bien por calidad precio la recomiendo",Wowwhatadeals,Wowwhatadeals

It folds so wasy to store. Dries hair quickly, but best of all is a lot less noisy than most dryers. This is the best hairdryer I have ever used, you won't regret buying.,I love this hair dryer as it is not as loud as the others.  I have a short bob and my hair dries in like 5 minutes.,The look comes out smoother.  Im a happy camper,It is light weight, quiet, great drying power. I would like to know if the smell will go away. I would also like to have the instructions and warranty in English.,Really incredible for such a small hair dryer.,Very simple and easy to use. Impressively quiet compared to other hair dryers even in the most quiet mode.,For anyone who does not like the sound of hairdryers, this is the one for you. The highest setting is not super noisy, it's hot enough, and it's effective. It also has two other settings including a lighter warm setting which is even less noise, and a cool setting (even less noise, it's good for setting, and kinda calming/cooling after a shower!) The hairdryer is not very heavy, it folds, and I think the design is quite cute too (I love the color). I highly recommend it!,This hair dryer is super quiet compared to all others I have heard.  I bought this after watching my wife blast my young daughters ears for 20+ min to dry her long hair in the winter so she wouldn't have wet hair.  The noise level was awful for me in the next room and her young ears are being pummeled by some low rent dryer.  I was unable to determine if the American version is quiet.  This model explicitly stated it's dB rating.  Because it is from Japan, it does not have a GFCI plug.  This is fine for us since our bathroom plugs are all GFCI but something to be aware of.  It does work on 110-120 VAC without issue.  The folding handle is a nice feature for additional storage options.  As for performance,  it is certainly quiet and very acceptable for use around someone's head.  You can actually have a conversation.  It may be a bit slower to dry their hair but not noticeably longer and more than worth the improvement in noise reduction.  I cannot speak to the ion generation.  I would have to ask my wife if she thinks it reduces static and helps with drying.  She was skeptical at first and wanted to know why I thought it necessary to pay 3x what her drugstore dryer cost and why I would wait 3-4 weeks. She is impressed at how much nicer drying hair is without the ear splitting racket.  The instruction manual is pretty much useless to anyone that cannot read Japanese but I think you can figure out how to use it just fine.,I only wish the US version would verify it is equally quiet so I could recommend it and not have to wait for it to ship from Japan.,Two thumbs up.",2reasons,2reasons

Has multiple interchangeable pieces. The only set back .. Is that it us bulky.

                , This blow dryer has quickly become my favorite ever. The whole thing is refined, that is intelligently designed.  The slip stream attachment is reminiscent of the $300 RevAir but I can't compare because I've never used one of those, but this was a good and different attachment. One attachment fits a round brush- wonderful. The diffuser was also perfect. The comb is THE BEST! It's not a cheap shallow double comb like most blow dryers. I have long THICK hair and this comb is so perfect. It's easy to switch blow dryer intensity. I bought one and my daughter loved it so much, I had to buy myself another one as she thanked me for the gift. I highly recommend this blow dryer and I usually hate them. 😎,This is a pretty good hair dryer.  It's medium sized and isn't too heavy. I bought it mainly for the unique shape of the diffuser. It snaps on very well and stays put. This hair dryer has great power but I'm surprised at how much air comes through the diffuser almost like it's a regular hair dryer without the attachment. I have baby thin hair that thined over the years. I don't use a hair dryer every day so I think I can make this work.,Honestly my ONLY complaint is the location of the cool shot button. If it was a little lower it would be easier to avoid. Other than that I love how well it works for my super long relaxed hair. The comb attachment is solid and doesn't come off during use. Affordable and it was here faster than I expected considering world events. Forgot to get a picture just after blow drying but here's one after flat ironing. It worked quickly with and without blow dry cream pictured beside it. The comb is my regular attachment. Havent used the others yet.,My favorite attachment is the diffuser. I like to wear my hair curly so it works great for that. The straightening attachment is a little hard to maneuver as you need to put hair in the opening so I use the comb attachment for straightening. It does make my hair frizz if I try and use the styling attachments but that's too be expected. Overall a great dryer for the money.,I have thick curly hair. I really wanted to love this dryer. Don't get me wrong, the heat settings and dryer is powerful, but it was no match for my type 4 hair. When blow drying my hair straight with the wide tooth comb, the attachment pops off, even after I detangle my hair. I had to revert back to my old hair dryer and attachment to get the job done. Its still a nice dryer but I will not use it to blow dry my hair straight.,Me gustó que cuenta con diversos accesorios para secar y moldear el cabello.",,

I can tell it is about to go out, so I'm price shopping for another one.  However, I've used this on average 3-5 times a week.  This has lasted much better than my top of the line Chi ever thought about giving me, and I will definitely look for this brand again (if not purchase this exact one again!).,As the sister of a very sweet cosmetologist, she always makes sure I have the absolute BEST of anything hair related - shampoo, conditioner, flat iron, curling iron, blow dryer, etc.  With that, I had a Chi blow dryer, top of the line, ionic, you name it, it had it!,I do have thick, long hair.  But it takes forever to dry, so I had used it very LIGHTLY for 1 year and 3 months before something went bad and it no longer heated (a very common problem).  Let me stop here and clarify light use on thick hair - I wash my hair about every other day.  I would use the Chi to dry my bangs (short) and just the very top roots, not even the top layer, just the roots.  Sometimes at night, I wouldn't use the dryer at all and let my hair air dry then use the curling/straight iron the next morning.  It probably had an average use of 10 minutes a week.  The warranty (though very lame) is for a year, so I called and they were basically no help (barely understood English).  I thought after all the money spent on Chi's (and how many my sister had sold for them), they would be of SOME help.,I couldn't spend money on a Chi again, just to have it go out with very light use in just over a year.  So I go to trusty Amazon for reviews... now, I can't buy a no-name brand because everyone who comes to my house expects me to have the best in hair care products (even my mother in law commented on how I have the best ""stuff"" and she loves excuses to stay and use my shampoo and conditioner lol).  So I found this one, a professional brand, I love my Hot Tools curling iron, with BETTER reviews than the Chi, Helen Of Troy, and all the other high ones - but with all the features.  Plus, I can order 4+ of these for the same price as one junky Chi - so I'm not in tears if it goes out in a year.  Of course, I place the order still terrified, ""What if it's not as good as my Chi???"",I have been using it for about 3 weeks.  And to kick it all, I like it BETTER than the Chi!!!  It will actually dry my full thick, long head of hair straight out of the shower in 10 minutes tops.  Which is wonderful, since I have a 7 month old and now I can go to bed with dry hair without spending all night trying to dry it.,I know it sounds like I am a paid advertiser for them.... but seriously, I'm that sold on this blow dryer and think everyone should know.  Adios Chi brand...,I wasn't in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!,FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the ,. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a 'Very Important Family Event' scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.,I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own. Oh, by the way, my Hot Tools Hair Dryer doesn't look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom! ~ Mrs. B.",,

Perfect.,I am just wanting to leave a review for this particular product since Marshalls doesn’t show this hairdryer in their website. It was only $24.99 at Marshall’s. I diffuse my hair and this came with 2 attachments for diffusing and they are perfect. I first use the bed head diffuser for 7 years but since the frame that holds your hair is made of metal, it started turning a hot red color and I ready reviewers say when that happened to theirs, it cut pieces of their hair off or actually set it on fire!!! So then I tried this ionic Revlon one that I got off of Amazon. It’s not bad but it’s no where near as good as this. It only had a cool and very hot setting so it would dry my hair too fast and cause damage and frizz. My non has this hair dryer so I had to get one after my previous fails! This has SIX different settings. It has cool, warm and hot buttons as well as low and high buttons and it has a extra cold button at the top. I have never gotten frizz from using this hair dryer EVER. It makes my hair look shiny, bouncy and soft. I tip my head down over the head of the hairdryer and blow dry it and that creates a ton of volume. I do the same thing on the left and right side of my head. GET THIS HAIR DRYER!!! It is worth the money even on Amazon! Best investment for your hair!,

I use it once, maybe a touch up as well and care for it, no abuse. It only works on High Heat and full power also is getting a strange smell ?? Time for a new one and back to Salono!,I bought this dryer in September of 2018 after reading hair dryer reviews. I loved it for the nearly two years I used. It dried quickly and was light in weight. Just this month, August 2020, the motor revved up to high on its own and then sparked and smoked. I bought it because it should have lasted many years, even with my using it nearly daily, although I hardly ever used it on the high setting. Maybe it was a fluke. It's past the 12-month warranty, so I don't have any recourse. So, buyer beware.,I have had several Elchims over the years. They are traditionally known for their power and heat and typically last 2 - 3 years. This one was different. It lasted two months and lost almost all power. I was informed by Amazon to contact the manufacturer as it was under warranty and they demanded that I send it back with a check for $15 so they could see what was wrong with it and determine if I had dropped it (in other words, if I was lying). I told them I cannot do this as I cannot be without a dryer and I also didn't feel like it was appropriate. He responded by saying that they are doing what ""any other existing company"" does. What a ridiculous statement.,I am left with an expensive, two month old, inoperable hair dryer and will be looking to switch to a new brand. Do NOT go near this vendor. They are obviously selling faulty products that last just beyond the 30 days available to return on Amazon. Waste of time and money!!,This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned. High head and very powerful.  I have thick hair and it takes forever to dry. I can dry my whole head with this dryer in 20 min. It is well worth $100!!!!

Needed this for awhile.,Best hair dryer I’ve everything bought. I got this dryer to do my son’s loc’s and this is perfect. The hose did fall off a few times but you have to turn it until it clicks into place. It doesn’t say that in the directions. I read that in another review. This was definitely not a waste of money. I want to buy this for my my and sister as Xmas gifts.,It is lightweight and easy to store.  However, the hose does not stay in cap, and when you move around it comes apart and you have reconnect.,I've used this a few times to dry my hair. I love the convenience of just putting on the bonnet and being able to work on my computer at my desk. My hair does not get frizzy, but I don't know if that's because of the dryer or the fact it's winter and my hair doesn't frizz in the winter time. I tried watching a movie the first time I used this product, but I had to turn the tv up too loud. I ordered this product because the description said there is a 6-foot hose. This is a 3-foot hose (probably closer to 30 inches), which makes a huge difference in where I can put it while drying my hair. The hose isn't long enough to place the machine on the ground. I'm wondering who tested the product, and if it was tested by real women in real situations. If the dryer is on my glass-top work desk, it must be lying down because when the dryer is on and standing up, it moves across the desk from the force of its fan. So a little velcro or something on the bottom would be helpful. Because of where the hose and electric cord come out of the side, (hose on top and cord on the bottom) it can be difficult to get situated. The machine must be on your left side because it is not the 6-feet of hose as described. I lock the bonnet into the hose as other reviewers have said to do, but sooner or later, the hose gets very hot, and the pieces come apart. Then I have to wait a few minutes for it to cool off and reattach. So HOT TOOLS, if you're reading this, the longer hose as described, rubber feet on the bottom, and a stronger lock for the bonnet-hose connection would make this a really great product.,The dryer does great for getting very hot, BUT the bonnet comes detached from the hose constantly. The bonnet and the hose don’t  click into place and since the hose is short the hose falls out of the bonnet all the time especially if you move your head. If they fix that it would be a great hair dryer.,My daughter has biracial hair and it’s always a struggle to dry her hair-she likes to wash it at night..? Why?? lol. I finally decided to invest in this guy and wow, what a game changer. In about 20-25 minutes her head, of a lot of hair, was completely dry and not dried out. I am very impressed, as was my daughter!,Note; when you open the package there are no instruction & I thought there were missing pieces; the bonnet and the connector hose. Turns out both are neatly tucked away inside of the hairdryer mechanism! What a bonus, no loose parts to lose! Also, you have to twist the hose connection into the bonnet or it will just fall out. Once we figured that out we were good to go. I highly recommend!!,I mean look. I really really hate styling my hair. I am an air-dry girl all the way. If you are too, hi! This suits my 2a locks more than any $200 ionic blow dryer/ diffuser could. Just add product, twist & pin hair, slap this baby on with some earplugs and crank it to medium and you’re GOLD. It’s light and powerful, and you are hands-free the whole time. Do your make-up, read a book, doomscroll on your phone, whatever— it’s BONNET TIME! Also good for heat-setting curls and deep hair-mask treatments.  I dunno now I feel dumb raving about a hairdryer but what can I say, it’s a game changer for me. Ok bye.,I would advise anyone buying electrical goods from the US to check that there is information about the voltage of the product.  I had a lot of problems because I had to learn about this myself.  There's no information from the seller, on the product or the information leaflet.  I had to google the information to find out that i needed to get a converter plug.  I'm not an electrician, I don't feel that I should be running around to get voltage information, then to get additional equipment BEFORE I get to use a hairdryer.",NJ1C,NJ1C

I see words like ""ion generator"" and my eyes glaze over, because I have two post-grad degrees in the sciences, and am impervious to the fake science-y sounding claims that companies use to sell product. That said, in late 2020 I found myself with short, untamable hair after I let my stylist hack off WAY too much when I finally got in for a cut (assuming I was in for another long wait thanks to COVID). My cheap but serviceable dryer seemed to be frying it on the regular, and I had to apply MORE heat in the form of curling iron and/or straightener to get a head of hair I'd want to leave the house (or hop on Zoom) with. My usual taming products weren't helping much. This was extra frustrating because right after she cut it (and blew it out), it had seemed fresher and healthier than it has in years.,I honed in on the blow dryer as the primary source of my frizz woes (for reference, I have pretty thick, medium-textured hair. Won't curl except in very specific climatic conditions, but is naturally wavy to frizzy, humidity and product dependent). I honestly didn't do a TON of research, because who's got that kind of time? But I did read a bunch of reviews on here, a couple Strategist articles, and decided to give the T3 Cura a go while it was on sale, figuring if I was proved right that money can't give you better hair, I could it return it--no harm no foul.,First impressions:  as some others have noted, it looks like cheap, glossy plastic. If I wasn't programmed by the rose gold accents and seeing T3 on a dozen IG/style blogs, I'd have thought it was from Walmart. Definitely expected it to look classier. But looks aren't everything! Determined to give it the exact same shake my normal dryer gets, I first just blew my hair dry the quick and dirty way: head flipped, giving it the business all over.,Performance:  it's hella fast, even on on the lowest heat setting, and WAY less noisy (I wouldn't have said my old dryer's sound level annoyed me, but by comparison? it really, really did). While not lightweight, it's easy to hold and comfortable in the hand. I didn't have any problems with the buttons as some reviewers have. But the machine def does not turn off when I set it down, which I...thought was a feature? Oh well. The cold button was VERY easy to hit, and not having to hold it down meant I could easily give my whole head a cool blast at the very end, which I loved.,Appearance:  Things like speed and noise are really secondary to the main issue of how my hair looked after getting blasted with it. And honestly? Pretty dang good. No other heat tools necessary for public exposure/a decent selfie. Much smoother, way less frizz (and oh yeah, my neck wasn't sweating by the time it was dry--fun bonus!). It's got good movement, and I can see how, with a little extra round brush/sectioning effort, it could look great. Was it a salon-like blowout? No, because I did not magically become a professionally trained stylist when I picked it up, and I blew it dry in the laziest way possible. Do I *feel* a little fancier, lolling around the house sporting pretty smooth hair without having to fudge with heat tools and styling? I AM NOT ASHAMED TO SAY THAT I DO.,In sum:  the question now is whether these improvements are worth $180 (or $235 if you don't catch it on sale). It's a giant indulgence which would be worth it for my hair health and my ego in the long run if the dryer lasts . . . but I have the niggling fear, based on several reviews here, that it may not. And while the claim is a 2-year warranty, given how product warranties sometimes work on Amazon (i.e. they don't), it could end up being an exorbitant price for a short-term product. So, I'm still making up my mind. And enjoying some decent hair while I do.,After my most recent blow dryer quit on me a month after my warranty expired, I did major research on a new brand. I paid a good amount for my last dryer and was NOT happy it didn’t last but a year and a month, used biweekly for 15 min at a time. I knew I needed a new brand so the hunt began.,I did quite a bit of research as I believe good quality hot tools means healthy hair. It was between this and a Dyson. I chose this dryer as I was not thrilled with the button placement on the Dyson.,I saw results immediately and even after two uses, my hair dresser (who I see regularly) commented on my hair. The only thing that I changed was my dryer.,First- this dryer makes round brushing the easiest I have ever done. So much so that I haven’t used my round brush blow dryer that was my go to for blowouts. This dryer is light so I have zero issues with the weight. The size it perfect making it super easy to round brush my long hair that reaches the middle of my back. The buttons are in the perfect spot and easy to use. The nozzles are on tight so no problem with them falling off during blow drying.",,

Thought I would try a different brand.  This one doesn’t get so hot that it burns me or my hair and this actually dries my long hair in half the time as my old ones.  So very happy with this purchase,I think this does a much better job than my Revlon (I had the original).  I only have one complaint, and it’s that it’s extremely loud! I thought maybe it wasn’t too bad, but every time I turn it off, my ears stay ringing. If it wasn’t for how loud it is, I’d rate it 5 stars.,Me encanta me alisa y cepilla muy bien el cabello, tengo una melena muy abundante y demoro solo media hora, antes con otro cepillo, secadora y planchas podia demorar hasta hora y media,Es la mejor compra del mundo,Probé este cepillo y el acabado en el cabello es maravilloso, pero lo más impresionante es en el tiempo que lo hice. Lo mejor que tendrás en tu vida!,From towel damp hair out of the shower to bouncy blow out in 20 minutes flat! I could never successfully start and finish a blow out at home. My arms get tired from trying to manipulate the round brush with one hand and the dryer with the other. Love this combo and its easy to use! Definitely worth the price.,Works well, but if you are using your opposite hand to work the hair watch out, it gets really hot. The barrel is very large, has great tension for smoothing hair but doesn't get as much volume as smaller barrels.,I bought this after seeing the Amika brush blow dryer on Tik Tok and I am so glad I chose to buy the Hot Tools instead! This one you can buy different size attachments for and is half the price! Works great on my short shoulder length hair. I don’t even need a straightener with this! Highly recommend!,Love my hair dryer/ brush. Very easy to use and convenient for traveling. Life saver for me since I always need to have my hair done 10-15 min top and I am ready. Strongly recommend this one!!!!!,A mí esposa le encantó",,

This little adequately lightweight red thing is wonderful and dries my hair quickly without my working up a sweat in my tiny bathroom while using it. The 3 heat settings in addition to the cool shot is fantastic and though the highest setting doesn't seem to get as hot as other dryers, that doesn't seem to take away from the efficiency of this product and I personally prefer it this way. The shorter nose part of the dryer took some practice to get used to but I also now prefer this size since I no longer need to hold my arms all the way out or up, to use this on my quite long hair. The blue light on it, helps me see where I'm aiming the dryer nose when in use however I'm sure the light is designed for something else entirely. ..not that I know what that's for. Ha!,It came brand new & well-packaged and somehow managed to show up in under 48 hours! Nice work by the seller and the manufacturinf company!,I bought this hair dryer because I loved my previous Chi.  This one doesn’t seem to be quite as powerful or get as hot (despite 2 speeds and 3 heat settings).  I still like it a lot, though.  My hair is not full of static after I use it and for that it’s worth the money.,I like the size of this hair dryer and the speeds and low, medium and high drying it offers.  There are many options out there and this was the third one I tried.  I have naturally curly hair but mostly prefer to straighten it.  I have not tried the diffuser that comes with it yet.,It's a little big for travel.,I love everything about this blow dryer! Not too heavy, long cord, different speed and temperature settings plus a cool button. I love the power and how my hair feels after drying, plus the fact I get it done much quicker. It’s not as harsh or as loud as my old Chi. I recommend it highly,I purchased this for travel as it is smaller than most hair dryers and it works great and is light weight.  I definitely recommend this for everyday and/or travel.  It's high quality and dries like a full size dryer.  It's not at all like the cheap hairdryers in hotels.  High quality.,This review is going to get really petty really fast.,Starting this out with some info for potential buyers to compare and contrast:,I have dry, brittle, damaged, thinning hair from thyroid issues rn. It's not very long (a couple of inches below my collarbone) and should be a very easy type of hair to dry. So explain to me why with multiple tries now at an hour in, with sectioned out hair as not to overwhelm this compact dryer; my hair is still a lil bit damp. AN HOUR. If I were to air dry my hair it would dry nearly at the same rate as going through this process with this product, somehow.",,

Es el mejor para mi pues es súper liviano y te deja el pelo muy bonito y en mucho menos tiempo. Lo amo!,I am a hairdresser I LOVE this dryer,I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I have to on this purchase.  I have two young daughters and I am blowing out their hair all the time along with mine.  It takes a lot of time to do this all.  I have three other Bio Ionic blow dryers along with their flat iron and brush.  They are the best.  We all have curly hair so we need to fix our hair a lot.,So, this is by far the strongest and most efficient blow dryer I have ever used.  It is also so very light.  I was surprised.  It is so strong that when I was using it and my husband turned on the microwave my electric shut off on that side of my house and my husband had to go in the garage to flip the circuit breaker.  So, I figure it's using a lot of power.  I have never had that happen with another blow dryer.  So, it;s obviously super strong.  It blows out our hair well too.  I feel like it takes less time to dry our hair which is why I bought it because I am doing three people's hair right now.,I used all my Amazon points to buy it so I only ended up paying $70 when I bought it., So, I would definitely recommend buying this blow dryer.  Yeah,  it's very expensive but for me it's worth the time and energy that we take to get ready because I don't have any extra time in my schedule raising two young girls and most other people I know don't have extra time either to blow out their hair and get ready to go out.  Worth every penny!,This new dryer is amazing.  It is extremely light (less than a pound) and actually much lighter than my old bio ionic powerlight.  The nozzle is very easy to take on and off and it's great because the dryer itself does not overheat.  My hair normally takes 15-25 minutes with a typical dryer.  I have very long, thick, curly and easily frizzy hair.  The 10x takes me between 9-12 minutes but the result is much better with the 10x than my old powerlight.  This dryer makes my hair feel exceptionally soft, light, defrizzed, and smooth, without the need for a flat iron--definitely the best blow out I've had in a long time!  The cold button is great and I think the variety of settings is more than enough for me. The bio ionic powerlight would take me between 10-14 minutes depending on the humidity outside and how conditioned my hair is, so in terms of time, I found the 10x to definitely be faster overall with a better overall result.  My stylist recommended the bio ionic brand in 2012.  I bought the bio ionic powerlight 4 years ago and it does a great job at reducing styling time and smoothing out my hair.  However, I find the new 10x to be more effective at not drying out my hair as much.  The 10x definitely gives more shine and reduces frizz substantially.  The dryer still works great but I wanted to try a new dryer.  I will keep the powerlight as a travel/back up dryer.  By the way, I have burned out three T3 dryers in less than a year so having a ten year motor warranty is a big deal for me.  Bio ionic is hands down one of the best brands on the market for blow dryers and I find it to be well worth the money!,From the very first time I used this hair dryer, I noticed the difference. I've had it for over a year now, and when I travel and have to use a standard hair dryer, that's when I REALLY appreciate how great this one is. I have fine, straight hair, so nothing too difficult, but it really does help cut down on frizz and makes my hair so soft and smooth. I also love that the ""cool"" option stays on and works on all levels, it isn't just a blast like on most dryers. In the summer it's so nice to not have to use hot air at all! So much less damaging, too. It is a hair dryer, so it is never going to be silent, but I find it less screechy/high pitched than other dryers. I also can use it on a lower level and it still dries pretty fast. Yes, it is expensive, but considering the crummy cheap hair dryers I've gone through over the years, this one just blows them out of the water. If they made a travel version, I'd be thrilled.,Not powerful,I bought this hair dryer on the advice of my stylist. I have been discontented ever Since. The dryer aspect is no different than a MUCH CHEAPER BRAND and IT BURNS MY SCALP since there is NO HEAT CONTROL switch. I thought I was doing something wrong only to find out that my new stylist has the same complaint especially on short hair. Unfortunately I missed the window of returns but I basically threw out $280 since I’m now using my old, cheap dryer. And to make matters worse, I see I can’t contact the seller on Amazon any longer. I can’t understand why a hair dryer manufacturer can engineer a dryer that has speed controls but NO HEAT CONTROL!!",,

I also tried the healthy version, and it doesn't seem like much, but the weight difference in this one was really important to me. The first time I went to my hair stylist after getting this dryer she commented on what good condition my hair was in. I've also had a few times where someone will compliment my haircut, even though I haven't had a haircut in quite a while.,Okay, first the good stuff: like the effect  of the 3900 Healthy Ionic hair dryer,  makes my hair shiny and smooth. My hair was looking like straw, so replaced my 8-year d Baby Bliss and made a big difference. Very happy!,Cons: it's heavier than my Baby Bliss and you feel those extra ounces (Elchim weighs 1.47 lbs; Baby Bliss .94 lbs). I get an upper body workout while grooming - I can live with that.,Next, there may be an inconsistent quality issue - not sure. The black/silver is supposed to be the same as the black/rose gold model, though it's $11 more expensive. I thought maybe it was lighter bc the website says they're different weights. They are exactly the same weight - I ordered both to compare. But it seems like the black/silver blows harder. My husband and I rigged a test and the black/silver did blow harder, especially on the low speed. I have a ton of hair, so I'm keeping the black/silver and returning the black/rose gold. If you have thinner hair, the rose gold might be better, if there really is a difference in air flow and it's not just wacky Italian manufacturing.,Ok, I'm sold.  I have to say I was skeptical.  I've only owned the ""basic"" $30 hairdryer you get from Walmart my whole life, and I just hit 50 years old.  I've always thought it was stupid for people to spend more than that on a hairdryer just to get something else that blows air just like the cheaper ones did.  But, I started reading reviews and got curious - it appeared that different hair dryers might actually do different things.  I'd returned an item or two on Amazon and found that they make it pretty easy, so I decided to take the chance on this and just return it if I didn't feel it was worth the extra money.  Well, I'm keeping it.  In fact, I bought a second one for a friend for Christmas.  I have fine hair, but a decent amount of it, so it typically dries fairly quickly anyway, but this did cut down the drying time.  But for me, the selling point was more how my hair felt and looked afterwards.  I regularly color my hair and have been doing so for years, so sometimes it could look a little dried out and ""strawlike,"" especially in the back.  After using this dryer, and even more so after using it for a week or so, my hair doesn't look dry or strawlike anymore, but silkier and much healthier.  Then, my friend tried it.  She has very long, very thick hair.  She's the active, sporty mom-type that hates spending the time doing her hair and often will just pull it up because of that.  She timed herself using her own regular dryer and it took her 10 min to dry her hair.  The next day, she used mine - the Elchim - and timed it again and it literally cut it down by at least 50% to 4-5 min.  And not only that, her hair looked like a Pantene commercial!  She usually has some waves in it that she will flat-iron out, but really didn't need to after using this dryer, so her total time to do her hair was only about 5-6 minutes, which she was thrilled about - hence the Christmas present idea.  Also, I have had some issues with my hair kinking about 2-3 inches out from the roots on the top of my head that I always had to flat iron out, even though I would use my hair dryer, big round brush, cold shot, etc., with my old dryer.  My stylist said it was probably because as I was getting more grey strands, which are more resistant.  I was amazed to see that, with this dryer, the kinks are not there - maybe just slightly here or there, but pretty much gone!  I also haven't had to use my flat iron much, some days not at all, with this dryer, which helps keep my hair healthier too. And I can completely dry and style my hair in less time too.  I don't know exactly how the science works, but I'm glad it does!  I won't go back to the old cheap dryers anymore.,I've bought three of these hair dryers, because I haven't found anything better to use on my curly hair - which gets way too curly and frizzy in the humidity of summer. The first one is now three years old. I had to replace the plug, but that was not the manufacturer's fault - I pulled it out of the wall too many times too vigorously. Once I replaced the plug, it continues to work great!  I bought a second one a few months ago to keep at another location - that worked well until last week when the switch to switch it on stopped working. That was not good because I was about to go out and my hair was wet from the shower. I was able to toggle it to get a weak air flow so I could dry my hair for three days until the one I'm using now arrived. I think the seller or manufacturer should replace it. I'll try conctacting them and will update.,I spent the extra money and bought this hair dryer because I wanted a hair dryer that was lightweight and could dry my hair quickly with less heat. I was very disappointed when my hair came out very frizzy. I tried all the combinations of heat and speed it offered and got the same result so I took it to my hair dresser to see what I was doing wrong. She tried it and said the problem wasn't me, because she got the same results and recommended that I return it. Unfortunately, by the time I got through trying to make it work, the return time had expired. I guess I'll give it to someone with very straight hair that wants to add some volume.,
